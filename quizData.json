            "options": [
              "A: The LLM directly modifies the user’s calendar in Salesforce without further verification",
              "B: The LLM interprets the user’s request, identifies the appropriate action, and uses Salesforce’s scheduling API to create a calendar event",
              "C: The LLM sends a generic email to the client requesting a meeting time",
              "D: The LLM requires manual input from the user to execute the scheduling"
            ],
            "correct_answer": "B",
            "explanation": "The LLM processes the natural language input, understands the request to schedule a meeting, and then uses Salesforce’s scheduling API to create the event."

            "question": "A customer support team is integrating Salesforce Einstein Copilot into their operations. They plan to use standard copilot actions to automate ticket creation and follow-ups but also need to create custom actions for handling escalations based on specific criteria, such as issue severity and customer status. What is the best approach for implementing these actions?",
            "options": [
              "A: Apply standard copilot actions for both routine and complex tasks to simplify the process",
              "B: Focus on developing custom copilot actions for all tasks to ensure full customization",
              "C: Leverage standard copilot actions for routine tasks and create custom actions for escalations that require specific handling",
              "D: Use a manual process for all tasks to ensure accuracy and control over the support process"

            "correct_answer": "C",
            "explanation": "Using standard copilot actions for routine tasks ensures efficiency, while custom actions are necessary for handling more complex situations like escalations."
